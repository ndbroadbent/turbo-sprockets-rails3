# Turbo Sprockets for Rails 3.2.x

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3.png)](http://travis-ci.org/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3)

* Speeds up your Rails 3 `rake assets:precompile` by only recompiling changed assets, based on a hash of their source files
* Only compiles once to generate both fingerprinted and non-fingerprinted assets


### Disclaimer

`turbo-sprockets-rails3` can now be considered relatively stable. A lot of compatibility issues and bugs have been solved, so you shouldn't run into any problems.
However, please do test it out on your local machine before deploying to a production site, and open an issue on GitHub if you have any problems. By using this software you agree to the terms and conditions in the [MIT license](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/turbo-sprockets-rails3/blob/master/MIT-LICENSE).


## Usage

Just drop the gem in your `Gemfile`, under the `:assets` group:

```ruby
group :assets do
  ...
  gem 'turbo-sprockets-rails3'
end
```

Run `bundle` to install the gem, and you're done!

Test it out by running `rake assets:precompile`. When it's finished, you should see a new file at `public/assets/sources_manifest.yml`, which includes the source fingerprints for your assets.

Go on, run `rake assets:precompile` again, and it should be a whole lot faster than before.

Enjoy your lightning fast deploys!

## Removing Expired Assets

`turbo-sprockets-rails3` provides a Rake task called `assets:clean_expired`. You can run this task after `assets:precompile` to remove outdated assets.

An asset will be deleted if it is no longer referenced by `manifest.yml`, and hasn't been actively deployed for more than a day (default).

You can configure the expiry time by setting `config.assets.expire_after` in `config/environments/production.rb`.
An expiry time of 2 weeks could be configured with the following code:

```ruby
config.assets.expire_after 2.weeks
```

## Versioning

The gem needs to support multiple changes to Rails and sprockets, so the following versioning is used:

* Rails 3.2.0 to 3.2.8 uses `turbo-sprockets-rails3` `0.2.x`
* Rails 3.2.9 and higher uses `turbo-sprockets-rails3` `0.3.x`


## Compatibility

### [asset_sync](https://github.com/rumblelabs/asset_sync)

Fully compatible.

### [wicked_pdf](https://github.com/mileszs/wicked_pdf)

Fully compatible starting from version `0.8.0`.

```ruby
gem 'wicked_pdf', '>= 0.8.0'
```

<hr/>

Please let me know if you have any problems with other gems, and I will either fix it, or make a note of the problem here.

## Deployments

### Capistrano

`turbo-sprockets-rails3` should work out of the box with Capistrano. The latest version of Capistrano now supports asset rollback and automatic expiry.

### Heroku

I've created a Heroku Buildpack for `turbo-sprockets-rails3` that keeps your assets cached between deploys, so you only need to recompile changed assets. It will automatically expire old assets that are no longer referenced by `manifest.yml` after 7 days, so your `public/assets` folder won't grow out of control.

To create a new application on Heroku using this buildpack, you can run:

```bash
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/ndbroadbent/heroku-buildpack-turbo-sprockets.git
```

To add the buildpack to an existing app, you can run:

```bash
heroku config:add BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ndbroadbent/heroku-buildpack-turbo-sprockets.git
```

#### Compiling Assets on Your Local Machine

You can also compile assets on your local machine, and commit the compiled assets. You might want to do this if your local machine is a lot faster than the Heroku VM, or if you also want to generate other files, such as static pages. When you push compiled assets to Heroku, it will automatically skip the `assets:precompile` task.

I've automated this process in a Rake task for my own projects. The task creates a deployment repo at `tmp/heroku_deploy` so that you can keep working while deploying, and it also rebases and amends the assets commit to keep your repo's history from growing out of control. You can find the deploy task in a gist at https://gist.github.com/3802355. Save this file to `lib/tasks/deploy.rake`, and make sure you have added a `heroku` remote to your repo. You will now be able to run `rake deploy` to deploy your app to Heroku.

## Debugging

If you would like to view debugging information in your terminal during the `assets:precompile` task, add the following lines to the bottom of `config/environments/production.rb`:

```ruby
config.log_level = :debug
config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)
```
